// To achieve a pleasant vertical rhythm, we use Compass' Vertical Rhythm mixins
// so that the line height of our base font becomes the basic unit of vertical
// measurement. We use multiples of that unit to set the top and bottom margins
// for our block level elements and to set the line heights of any fonts.
// For more information, see http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm

// Vertical Rhythm, add and/or remove tags as your baseline grid needs.
